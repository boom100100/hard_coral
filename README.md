# Hard Coral

## Description
Generate a musical performance with lyrics consisting of a webpage's content.

The MVP of this project will aim to immediately begin singing a portion of text of a minimum size upon clicking on the extension button.

Later iterations will allow the user to point and click at sections of text for the extension to sing. This will require determining granularity: defining an appropriate start and end point for a section of a page.

## Package
MacOs has weird compression issues when making .zip files, so use the following command for creating .zip to upload to Google:

    zip -r .chrome_extensions_assets/hard_coral0.0.v.zip *

Be sure to update the version number for the output.
