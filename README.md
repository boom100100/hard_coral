# Hard Coral

## Description
Generate a musical performance with lyrics consisting of a webpage's content.

The MVP of this project will aim to immediately begin singing a portion of text that the user idicates.

Later iterations will allow the user to choose between singing and non-singing readouts.

## Package
MacOs has weird compression issues when making .zip files, so use the following command for creating .zip to upload to Google:

    zip -r .chrome_extensions_assets/hard_coral0.0.v.zip *

Be sure to update the version number for the output.
