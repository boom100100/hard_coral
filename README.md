# Hard Coral

## Description
Generate a musical performance with lyrics consisting of a webpage's content.

The MVP of this project will have the following features:

- point and click at highlighted sections of text for the extension to sing
- double-click to interact with a link or button
- toggle the extension on and off by clicking the extension button

## Package
MacOs has weird compression issues when making .zip files, so use the following command for creating .zip to upload to Google:

    zip -r .chrome_extensions_assets/hard_coral0.0.v.zip *

Be sure to run this from the root of the project and update the version number for the output!
